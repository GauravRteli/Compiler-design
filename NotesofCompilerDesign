Flex (Fast lexical Analyzer Generator): 
    It  is tool / computer that is used to generate lexems of the program.

Flex reads user-specified input files and produces as output a C source file that defines a scanner that can read input and recognize the patterns specified in the input files.
flex and bison both are more flexible than lex and yacc and produce faster code.

yylex() is automatically generated by the flex when provided with a.l file and this yylex() function is expected by parser to call to retrieve the tokens token stream.

only can match the 8-byte binary values or we can say characters.

GCC provides several optimization options that can be used to improve the performance of compiled code.default compiler on Linux and other Unix-like systems.

-O1, -O2, and -O3
